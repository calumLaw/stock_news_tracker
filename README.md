# Stock News Tracker

This script tracks the daily changes in the stock price of a specified company and sends an SMS notification if the stock price changes by 5% or more from the previous day. The notification includes the latest news articles related to the company.

## How It Works

1. **Stock Price Tracking**: The script fetches the daily stock price data for the specified company from the Alpha Vantage API, calculating the percentage change from the previous day's closing price.
2. **News Fetching**: If the percentage change is equal to or greater than 5%, the script then fetches the top three news articles related to the company from the News API.
3. **SMS Notification**: The selected news articles, along with the stock price change, are sent via SMS using the Twilio service. The messages include a visual indicator ("ðŸ”º" for a price increase, "ðŸ”»" for a price decrease) along with the percentage change, headline, and URL for each news article.

## Requirements

- An Alpha Vantage API key for fetching stock price data.
- A News API key for fetching news articles.
- Twilio account credentials (account SID and auth token) for sending SMS notifications.

## Configuration

The script requires the following variables to be set:

- `STOCK`: The stock symbol of the company you want to track (e.g., "TSLA" for Tesla Inc).
- `COMPANY_NAME`: The name of the company you want to track (e.g., "Tesla Inc").
- `STOCK_API_KEY`: Your Alpha Vantage API key.
- `NEWS_API_KEY`: Your News API key.
- Twilio `account_sid` and `auth_token`: Your Twilio credentials.
- Twilio phone numbers for `from_` and `to`: The sender and recipient phone numbers for SMS notifications.

## Usage

Simply update the `STOCK` and `COMPANY_NAME` variables with the desired stock symbol and company name, then run the script. It will check the stock price change for the specified company, and if the change is 5% or more, it will send an SMS notification with the latest news articles.
